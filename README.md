This program basically stops and starts services if you have installed Xentry to your daily laptop, and you can easily start them back up if needed.
Step 1, change all running MB services to start up manually, and remove any Xentry related apps from startup.
Step 2, run the script as admin, and stop services. Start them again with this if needed.
Happy diagnosing!
